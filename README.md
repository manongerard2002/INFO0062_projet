# Sokoban

## Score

* The project received a score of **18/20**

Comment: Compilation and run OK. Code rather clear and well modulated. Quite a shame that to add another level to your game, one would have to change the class Level, reading an input file and generating the level from it would have been more elegant.

## Execution

compile with: `javac -cp .;sokoban-gui.jar be/uliege/boigelot/oop/sokoban/main/Sokoban.java`

execute with: `java -cp .;sokoban-gui.jar be/uliege/boigelot/oop/sokoban/main/Sokoban`
